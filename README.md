# 🔍 DeepFake Research Project

> **Project short description:**  
> This repository contains the code, models, documentation and evaluation assets for a research project exploring *deep generative models for face synthesis and manipulation* (commonly referred to as "deepfakes"). The aim of this work is academic: to analyze model behaviour, evaluate detection strategies, study ethical implications, and propose mitigation techniques.

## ⚠️ Responsible Use & Ethics (Read First)

This project is intended **only** for legitimate, ethical, and research purposes (e.g., studying model behaviour, improving detection tools, benign entertainment with explicit consent, accessibility applications). **Misuse** (e.g., creating forged media to deceive, harass, defame or violate privacy) is strictly prohibited.

Before using any code, dataset, or model from this repository you must:

- Obtain **explicit, informed consent** from any person whose likeness is used.
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws and platform policies.
- Use generated content only in controlled, ethical contexts (research lab, dataset benchmarking with permissions, teaching demonstrations with clearly-labelled synthetic media).
- Clearly label any synthetic media as synthetic when publishing or sharing externally.
- Follow your institution’s research ethics / IRB guidelines where applicable.

If you plan to use this project for anything other than local research, contact the project maintainers (see **Contact**).

## 📌 Project Overview

**Goals**
- Explore generative face synthesis and face-swap techniques at a research level.
- Evaluate robustness and failure modes of synthesis models.
- Develop and benchmark detection/forensics methods.
- Propose and evaluate mitigation and watermarking strategies.

**What’s included**
- High-level model architecture descriptions and training scripts (research variants).
- Preprocessing pipelines for faces & video frames (face detection, alignment).
- Evaluation metrics and test harnesses (quality, identity preservation, lip-sync scores, detection accuracy).
- Baseline detection models and forensic analysis tools.
- Documentation in HTML format (see `docs/` or `docs/index.html`).

> ⚠️ This repository **does not** provide out-of-the-box instructions for deploying deepfakes for malicious uses. It is geared toward transparency, reproducibility of academic results, and detection/defense research.
